Hi there,

and congratulations on being courageous enough to try out my Ja2 Android port. 
(Use it at your own risk!)

This port is written for FUN and EDUCATION not for profit. I do not charge money 
for it, and neither should anyone else. The original game is still copyrighted 
and you need the original game to use this port (surprise!).

Just a COPYRIGHT WARNING: the copyright on Ja2 is currently held by an active 
company which might sue you, if you try to upload this to the market and charge 
money for it.
Offering it for free in the market might be okay, but please check it with the
copyright holders first!!!

Releasing builds/modified sources for education/non-profit is fine by the sourcecode
license. BUT: I integrated some GPL'ed code in the patch for reference only, THAT IS NOT
INCLUDED IN MY BINARY RELEASES AND DOES THEREFORE NOT VIOLATE GPL (specific #ifdef 
was inactive). 
But be aware that if you distribute changed versions of my patched code, that you
either remove TORVALDS BLOCK or just distribute a patch like I did here.

The code is rigged and hacked all over the place to work around the wchar_t flaws
introduced by androids NDK and the odd style of the original JaggedAlliance2 soucecode.
It was the hardest port I've ever done and some parts of the code might not meet
my usual style and quality. Sorry about that, but I did this in my freetime and had
to rush through some parts.

What I did:
- fixed ARM specific issues
- fixed most wchar_t on AndroidNDK related issues 
  (6 months of hunting broken pointers through the whole code)
- fixed most SDL flaws to be compatible with pelyaSDL (nasty search - easy fix)
- destroyed support for all other versions except ENGLISH - sorry :( 
- fixed file finding issues on Android 
- fixed file io issues with Android
- added some note to the main screen (only to keep players safe!)

The game should be playable, though I've not played it through on my device. If you
encounter bugs that prevent you from finishing the game, please let me know in the
forum (bearpit/jagalaxy/anddev not 4pda - I don't speak russian).

Special thanks here go to »Oleg "legion" Ilyasov«  to get me coding again. If this 
cool guy had not motivated me enough, I never would have made it this far! So: THANKS!

Also special thanks go to 'jaa' who posted small patch with a great effect! With 'jaa's
patch you can enjoy ja2android even on low-end android devices without speed problems!

Also thanks go to all testers from the forums where the port was released! Without all
of you, I never would have found some really nasty bugs! 

Some veterans at BearsPit where also very helpful during the whole project: thank you very much!

And also thanks to all I forgot to mention here! (It's just RC2 not stable1.0 ;))

So let's get to business:

I've (hopefully) included all neccessary stuff, speaking of which:

The patch should be applied to Revision7072 from svn://tron.homeunix.org/ja2/trunk
Should for some reason this SVN come offline, you can try dropping me a mail at
(omnigraphical @ gmail . com) but I can't promise I'll answer.
Questions regarding installation/patching/playing/whatever should be asked in
the Ja2Galaxy Forum or anddev.org.

Building is a little complicated:

ATTENTION: i forgot to deactivate the drop_all mod in the patch, please change droprates
back to normal if you want 100%pure Stracciatella feeling!


- Create an android build environment on you machine - google will help you with that.
(as the time of writing the NDKr6 is the most recent available NDK)
- You should use Crystax Toolchain instead. I used CrystaX-r6-2.

- Obtain the freshest pelyaSDL from github here https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius
I used version up to commit 8e16ec9f333ca3bbe11b15e1d2e0ae9e9d4b64be
(Beware: pelya breaks the whole thing sometimes...)

- follow pelyas instructions on how to compile your own application
  -  for sources you should of course use the checked out SVN of JA2 Stracciatella
     patched with the supplied patch.
     (run 'patch -p1 -i ja2_strac_svnr7072_to_ja2android_rc2.patch')
NOTE: I have not tested patching it with the new patch - but it should work. (you only need this patch!)
  - copy over the Icon and the two build and config files

- run build.sh from the pelya trunk, grab your phone and play some Exult while JA2 is
  building.

- you should now have a .apk file you can install on your phone

- Don't forget to move over your JA2 Data folder before trying to run the game.
  YES, OF COURSE YOU NEED TO OWN THE ORIGINAL GAME - it should be still in the stores!

- Hopefully: have fun!

LICENSE NOTE:
Jagged Alliance has its very own SirTech Open Source License, you should get a copy
of the license agreement when checking out from SVN. Or along with the archive where 
this file was in.

The small TORVALDS block I used for swprintf-reference is only contained in the patch
and not in the release. But it is licensed under GNU-GPL - check the Free Software Foundation
if you do not know what that is.

pelyaSDL/SDL have their own library license, just check their sites! 

I had to include pieces of code from the bsd-compat folder in the openssh sources, because
the google compiler does not know about glob.h and glob.c
